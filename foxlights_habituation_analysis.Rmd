Consider seasonality when looking at phase
Add ‘season’ to the phase_operation_dates_2020 google sheets

Plotting detections by week within a phase, maybe it was that 5 weeks is just not the best timeframe, confine it to a week perhaps instead. We chose 5 weeks bc they said that was the typical duration that they keep sheep in a pasutre.
Recreate the phase_operation_dates_2020 but change the ‘Start’ and ‘End’  to be one week long for each ‘week’
