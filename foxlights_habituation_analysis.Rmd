Consider seasonality when looking at phase
Add ‘season’ to the phase_operation_dates_2020 google sheets

 Plotting detections by week within a phase, maybe it was that 5 weeks is just not the best timeframe, confine it to a week perhaps instead. We chose 5 weeks bc they said that was the typical duration that they keep sheep in a pasutre.
Recreate the phase_operation_dates_2020 but change the ‘Start’ and ‘End’  to be one week long for each ‘week’ 






```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(subset(rai, Species == "CALA", Start == "10/7/18"), aes(x = Date, y = RAI, col = Foxlight, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line(color="black") +
  facet_wrap(~ Camera) +
  scale_x_discrete(label=function(x) abbreviate(x, minlength=1))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
